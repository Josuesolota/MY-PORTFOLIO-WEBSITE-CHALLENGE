            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>Health and Well-being
Naturally, as I am training in the health field, I enjoy good practices aimed at preserving health
 and sustainable development by applying technology to facilitate this process and life itself.

Automation and IoT
I love the idea of using technologies (like Artificial Intelligence, Arduino, etc.) to automate 
tasks so we have more time for other activities, to spend more time with family, and to get enough 
rest, thus preserving health. Controlling the environment via phone and remotely also attracts me a lot!

Web Programming
Projects like financial trading applications, online stores, and corporate LMS (Learning Management System) 
software are very good, and I would also like to work in this area!</p>
